# ESP32 Smart Weather Monitoring System (IoT Case Study)

This repository contains my MSc Robotics Engineering IoT coursework **case study**.  
In this work, I studied and designed an ESP32-based smart weather monitoring system and explained how it can be implemented in a real prototype.

## What the system is
A weather monitoring setup where an **ESP32** reads sensor data and publishes it to a cloud dashboard for remote viewing.

## Main features (proposed design)
- Temperature & humidity monitoring using **DHT21 (AM2301A)**
- Pressure monitoring using **BMP280**
- Wi-Fi connectivity with ESP32 for sending data to a cloud dashboard (example: **Blynk/IoT cloud**)
- Real-time monitoring using mobile/web dashboard widgets (graphs, gauges)

## What is included in this repo
- `docs/` → PDF report 

## Note
This repo is a **case study / design report**, so it does not include full implementation code or hardware build photos.
